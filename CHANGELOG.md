### Changed

- [BREAKING] attributes are always passed as keywords (@alassek)
This may affect your code in places where attributes are passed as hashes.
Places like

```ruby

Factory[:user, user_attributes]

```

must be updated to

```ruby
user_attributes = { name: 'Jane' }
Factory[:user, **user_attributes]
```

- Upgraded to the latest versions of dry-rb dependencies, compatible with rom 5.3 (@flash-gordon)
- Support for Faker 1.x was dropped (@alassek)
