      Support for unique options in `fake` DSL (@sean-dickinson in #94)

      ```ruby
      Factory.define(:user) do |f|
        f.name { fake(:name, unique: true) }
      end
      ```

      Be advised there's `Faker::UniqueGenerator.clear` to clear the cache of unique values.

      [BREAKING] attributes are always passed as keywords (@alassek)
      This may affect your code in places where attributes are passed as hashes.
      Places like

      ```ruby
      user_attributes = { name: 'Jane' }
      Factory[:user, user_attributes]

      ```

      must be updated to

      ```ruby
      user_attributes = { name: 'Jane' }
      Factory[:user, **user_attributes]
      ```
